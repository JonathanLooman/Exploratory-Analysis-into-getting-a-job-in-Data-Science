# Exploratory-Analysis-into-getting-a-job-in-Data-Science

## Project motivation and overview
 Looking at what are the best languages and tech to become familiar with to become a successful data scientist.<br>
The jupyter notebook Aspiring_data_scientist_blog_notebook shows the analysis done to enquire which languages and technologies are empirically the most popular and, therefore, the best to learn to get a job as a Data Scientist. <br>
A blog post futher discussing the analysis post can be viewed from a link in the notebook or with https://jlooman48.wixsite.com/website-1/post/technologies-to-succeed-in-data-science <br>

Specifically, three questions will be asked: <br> 

1. Which coding languages are most popular to data scientists.<br> 
2. Which Machine Learning frameworks are the most popular. <br> 
3. What is the best platform to share information on.<br> 

## Requirements
This project should be run with the following python libraries
- numpy 1.18.5
- pandas 1.0.5
- matplotlib 3.2.2
- seaborn 0.10.1
- scipy 1.5.0
