# Exploratory-Analysis-into-getting-a-job-in-Data-Science

## Project motivation 
 Looking at what are the best languages and machine learning tools to become familiar with to become a successful data scientist.<br>
Specifically, three questions will be asked: <br> 

1. Which coding languages are most popular to data scientists.<br> 
2. Which Machine Learning frameworks are the most popular. <br> 
3. What is the best platform to share information on.<br> 

## Requirements
This project should be run with the following python libraries
- numpy 1.18.5
- pandas 1.0.5
- matplotlib 3.2.2
- seaborn 0.10.1
- scipy 1.5.0

## Files in repository
- Aspiring_data_scientist_blog_notebook.ipynb -> analysis done to enquire which languages and technologies are empirically the most popular and, therefore, the best to learn to get a job as a Data Scientist.
- helper2.py -> Where functions are stored clean up notebook
- kaggle_survey_2020_responses.csv -> csv file of survey responses

## Results
